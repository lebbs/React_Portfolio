                    Hello, my name is Joonas Lepp√§nen and i am 
                    currently studying my last year in

                    by the end of december 2020.</p>

                    <p>My goal is to find a job with
                    interesting and new technologies
                    that will help me to develop my
                    skills even further. I am motivated
                    worker, because i want to advance
                    in my career and learn as much as
                    possible while doing so.</p>
